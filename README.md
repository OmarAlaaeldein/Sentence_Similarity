# Sentence_Similarity
A hobby experiment to investigate possibility of using word embeddings to analyze sentence similarity using a novel approach that does not necessitate using a whole transformer encoder block

## To-Do List

- [ ] Train the word2vec model on larger corpus.
- [ ] Experiment with different sizes of word embeddings.
- [ ] Modify the sentence_vector function to normalize vectors at each step.
- [ ] Test the sentence similarity function with various sentences.
- [ ] Evaluate the performance of the model.
- [ ] Implement the model with FastText and compare the performance.
- [ ] Explore possibilities of parallelizing operations for faster computation.
